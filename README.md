Repository with code for integrating HLF with HCS and ETH along with ML will be uploaded in increments
Hi There!
I am currently working on an ambitious project where I try to integrate Hyperledger Fabric with Hedera Consensus Service and Ethereum
This project is an attempt to build a private-public DLT network. Finally I will try to add machine learning to the mix
From the sound of it, you might have guessed it is a long-winded project
To make the process easy, I am working on smaller milestones
As I complete one milestone, I will be uploading the code to this is a repository
